## Inspiration
Isn't it frustrating browsing for information on COVID-19 only to find the information is either inaccurate or hard to understand? Don't you wish you could quickly contact a professional to conduct a fact check? That's what Caduceus is for. We aim to deliver information about COVID-19 in a clear and concise way then allow people to connect to professionals if they have questions!

## What it does
Caduceus is an all-in-one website where you can find all the basic information about Covid-19 as well as access to a doctor if you need it!

## How we built it
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Node.js
* Socket.io
* Vader Sentiment Analysis of NLTK library
* Machine Learning
* Python

## Challenges we ran into
* We had a few issues using GitHub desktop.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of learning new technologies and working well together as a team!

## What we learned
* Socket.io chatroom
* Github desktop

## What's next for Caduceus
* We can use questions to evaluate the competency of the doctor rather than taking their word for it if they say "yes"
* We could distribute the doctor-to-patient ratio to maybe around 1:3 instead of 1:1 for more efficiency.
